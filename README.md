# About
This repo contains sample queries for [Advanced hunting](https://securitycenter.windows.com/hunting) on [Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsforbusiness/windows-atp?ocid=queryrepogit).
With these sample queries, you can start to experience Advanced hunting, including the types of data that it covers and the query language it supports. You can also explore a variety of attack techniques and how they may be surfaced through Advanced hunting.

We are in the process of providing more documentation about Advanced hunting and its data schema. In the meantime, you can access the full list of tables and columns in the portal. [Read here to understand the query language](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=866515).
