# Detect activity associated with malicious DLL, cyzfc.dat

These queries was originally published in the threat analytics report, *Attacks on gov't, think tanks, NGOs*.

As described further in *[Analysis of cyberattack on U.S. think tanks, non-profits, public sector by unidentified attackers](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2018/12/03/analysis-of-cyberattack-on-u-s-think-tanks-non-profits-public-sector-by-unidentified-attackers/)*, there was a very large spear-phishing campaign launched in November 2019.

The attackers would gain access to a target by having the user click on a link to a compromised website and download a .zip archive.

Once established on a target's device, the attackers used a malicious DLL named *cyzfc.dat* to execute additional payloads. They would call a function in the malicious DLL via the legitimate Windows process, [rundll32.exe](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/rundll32), to connect directly to their command-and-control (C2) servers.

The following queries detect activity associated with the malicious DLL, cyzfc.dat., used in this campaign.

## Query

```Kusto
â€‹// Query 1: Events involving the DLL container
let fileHash = "9858d5cb2a6614be3c48e33911bf9f7978b441bf";
find in (FileCreationEvents, ProcessCreationEvents, MiscEvents,
RegistryEvents, NetworkCommunicationEvents, ImageLoadEvents)
where SHA1 == fileHash or InitiatingProcessSHA1 == fileHash
| where EventTime > ago(10d)

// Query 2: C2 connection
NetworkCommunicationEvents
| where EventTime > ago(10d)
| where RemoteUrl == "pandorasong.com"

// Query 3: Malicious PowerShell
ProcessCreationEvents
| where EventTime > ago(10d)
| where ProcessCommandLine contains
"-noni -ep bypass $zk='JHB0Z3Q9MHgwMDA1ZTJiZTskdmNxPTB4MDAwNjIzYjY7JHRiPSJ"

// Query 4: Malicious domain in default browser commandline
ProcessCreationEvents
| where EventTime > ago(10d)
| where ProcessCommandLine contains
"https://www.jmj.com/personal/nauerthn_state_gov"

// Query 5: Events involving the ZIP
let fileHash = "cd92f19d3ad4ec50f6d19652af010fe07dca55e1";
find in (FileCreationEvents, ProcessCreationEvents, MiscEvents,
RegistryEvents, NetworkCommunicationEvents, ImageLoadEvents)
where SHA1 == fileHash or InitiatingProcessSHA1 == fileHash
| where EventTime > ago(10d
```
