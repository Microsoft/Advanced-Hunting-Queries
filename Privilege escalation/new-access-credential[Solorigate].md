# Detect new access credentials added to app or service

This query was originally published in the threat analytics report, *Solorigate supply chain attack*.

Microsoft detects the [2020 SolarWinds supply chain attack](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/) implant and its other components as *Solorigate*. A threat actor silently added malicious code to legitimate software updates for Orion, which is IT monitoring software provided by SolarWinds. In this way, malicious dynamic link libraries (DLLs) were distributed to SolarWinds customers.

The following query detects when a new credential is added to an application or service principal. This may be an attempt to escalate privileges. This method is not specific to just this threat actor or this attack.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This query requires Microsoft 365 Defender.
