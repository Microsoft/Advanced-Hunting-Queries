# Domain federation trust settings modified
This query will find when federation trust settings are changed for a domain. Results will relate to when a new Active Directory Federated Service (ADFS) TrustedRealm object, such as a signing certificate, is added. 
Modification to domain federation settings should be rare, so confirm the added or modified target domain/URL is legitimate administrative behavior.

Solorigate - The actor was observed modifying domain trust settings to subvert existing mechanisms and cause the domain to accept authorization tokens signed with actor-owned certificates. https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/13/customer-guidance-on-recent-nation-state-cyber-attacks/

To understand why an authorized user may update settings for a federated domain in Office 365, Azure, or Intune, see: https://docs.microsoft.com/office365/troubleshoot/active-directory/update-federated-domain-office-365.
For details on security realms that accept security tokens, see the ADFS Proxy Protocol (MS-ADFSPP) specification: https://docs.microsoft.com/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-adfspp/e7b9ea73-1980-4318-96a6-da559486664b.
